# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe in Haskell – University Assignment

Welcome! This repository contains a functional implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game, developed in **Haskell** as part of a university assignment. While the grade is still pending, this project showcases my understanding of **functional programming**, modular code design, and decision-making logic in a purely functional context. It is featured on my CV as part of my academic portfolio.

## 🏆 Highlights

- ✅ Built in **pure Haskell** – no external libraries
- 🤖 Game includes logic for user input and simple AI (decision tree-based)
- 🧠 Modular structure using `Base.hs` and `DecisionTree.hs`
- 🎯 Fully interactive, console-based user interface

## 💼 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Functional programming (recursion, pure functions, pattern matching)
- Modular design in Haskell (`Main.hs`, `Base.hs`, `DecisionTree.hs`)
- AI decision logic via decision trees
- State handling and user interaction in the terminal
- Code clarity and reuse in a functional paradigm

- ## 📌 Academic Context

This project was submitted for the **Functional Programming** module at **University of Kent**. It demonstrates my ability to solve problems functionally and structure Haskell code into reusable components. The final version, in the `master` branch, was submitted for grading.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Structuring a functional application with clear separation of concerns
- Applying decision trees for simple AI behavior
- Recursion and state modeling in Haskell
- Writing interactive terminal apps in a purely functional style

## 🚧 Grade Pending

The grade for this project has not yet been released. This README will be updated when the final result is received.
